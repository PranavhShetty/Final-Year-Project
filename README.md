#NOVA- Next Gen Optimistic Virtual Assistance 

This was my final year project
Building this project required basic concepts of python and OOP
We had also intergrated this program in raspberry py and a robot speaker that dances on any tune played on it.
Also We also added an NLP part for questions or words that weren't hard coded, so that the program still has some response.
